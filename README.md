# uniprotpy

Python library that interfaces with UniProt API.

For something like [openvax/pyensembl](https://github.com/openvax/pyensembl) with UniProt.


### TODO

- Retrieve individual entries in all supported formats.
- Get metadata (protein ID, name, gene, # of isoforms, etc.) for entries.
- Retrieve proteomes via proteome ID or select "best" proteome based on taxon ID.
- Query proteomes for a protein by ID, name, seq, or peptide unit.
